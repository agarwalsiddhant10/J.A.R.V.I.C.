Hi
What happened?
Dont be disappointed. Tell what made you feel so
Hey, never think so. 
No, first tell me what happened
Focus on your studies now. These things keep happening in life
When are your tests?
You are a good student, you will easily clear your tests with fying colours
Have confidence in yourself
Everyone eists because of a reason
You will soon find out. But for now be cheerful.
Always remember to be happy in life. Never be disappointed of your failures. Failure is generally the first step to success
Yes, but remember that your return is a function of future rewards as well
I am asking you to tak to your parents now. Taliking with them will surely help
You have friends
Call them. Friends always have time for each other
For now cheer up then. Do something that you really like to do
You must be having a hobby
Thats great, I also like chatting to you
Great gather some friends and go out to play
Bye
