Hi
My day was very bad today.
My cycle broke again 
But I missed class due to this. And professor took class test
I am going through a bitter phase
I had a break up with my girlfriend. 
I fought with my parents.
I tried  but it seems they have disowned me
OKay lets see
I was trolled on facebook
I got very poor marks in all my subjects while my friends received As. Probably I will get a backlog.
Things never work out for me, I will never achieve what I want.
I have no real friends. Everyone backstabs me.
I have low class attendance.
I am addicted to drugs and alcohol. 
I have no money. I am born poor.
I didnot get a placement in my final year.
I feel insecure about my career.
My life has no meaning. Its all over now.
I am in no society or research groups. I am also very poor at sports. My CGPA is low.
I was bullied by seniors in my hall.
I have been deregistered due to low attendance
My next semesters are more tough.
I spend all the day studying still I get bad grades in the exams.
I got no internship offer inspite of being very talented.
I am afraid of interviews. They make me nervous.
I hid from my parents that I drink and smoke
All my friends will graduate but I have a semester back.
I never wanted to be an engineer but an artist.
My friend passed away in an accident. I am shacked and deeply hurt.
