Hey
I'm not feeling well
Nothing in my life is going well.
No one loves me
But that is the truth!
My crush doesn't like me back
I'm failing my tests anyways
From tomorrow
But for what, tests do not interest me, neither does life
Why do we exist
And what is the so called 'reason'?
Why should I be cheerful over something that I'll get to know in the future.
My current mood is a fuction of my present state
Future doesn't matter if I commit suicide now.
I am an orphan
Yeah, they are always busy
Okay, I'll try calling them tomorrow.
I'm good for nothing
i hobby is talking to chatbots
I like playing football
Thanks
